 In a year without Carnival: the most radiant festival in Brazil, **SAMBA** is an experiment around the impossible and non-existent movements of _Porta-Bandeira_ (Flag-bearer) and _Mestre-sala_ (Master of Ceremonies) recreated by Artificial Intelligence.
 Even as an artist and creator, I sometimes feel like a spectator of AI Creations, surprised and delighted with rare and strange images, colors, and movements created from numbers.
 It is an AI series that I have been working on for the past few years, so I hope you like it as much as I do.
 Yaak :)"

Who is interested in this Mars? Only heroes. — Raise your hand and say, I swear! — Why, Flash? — Swear that when I die, you will scatter my ashes on Mars. — That's not my concern, Batman. Most likely, at this moment i will be guarding the peace of earthlings on earth, and not Martians on Mars. — But there will be earthmen on Mars, too. If they move to Mars, they won't become Martians. — Superman, this is for now… After a few generations, they will. As it happened once on Earth.
